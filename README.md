# Basic Description
This Repository is my aproach to create a bundle of classes which can be used to build almost any Card game on them. 

# Informations to the Current version
At the Moment, the cards are only for games like Poker, Blackjack etc. 

# Future Plans / Possible Updates
I think about adding more customisation to the Cards, so that games like UNO are possible to. I even think about the possibility to create Custom Cards for games like a self made Hearthstone or something like this. But if this happens, it will be in the far future.

# Games implemented yet:

# HigherLower_Cardgame
This is an OOP approach to create a cardgame, where you have to guess, if the next card is higher or lower than the current

# BlackJack
This Version is not like one you play in Casinos. You play against other players. The Person closesd to a Hand Value of 21 Wins the Game. The Ace is counted as 1 or 10, based on whats better for you. If you draw and your hand Value raises over 21, you have automaticly lost.
